/**
 * The `Telemetry` class facilitates event and screen view tracking using the Google Analytics Measurement protocol. 
 * More details can be found here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/reference
 * - Note: Google has officially discontinued mobile analytics tracking through Google Analytics. It is recommended for new apps to use Firebase instead.
 * - Note: This library converts screen views into pageviews. Therefore, new tracking properties must be configured as websites in the Google Analytics admin console.
 * - Note: The app bundle identifier, which can be customized for privacy reasons, is used as a dummy hostname for tracking pageviews and screen views.
